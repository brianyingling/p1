                    <p>
                        I'm a former teacher who made a career change to web development about four years ago.
                        I'm currently working in the industry as a front end developer. I work with Javascript
                        daily but I'm eager to learn more server side development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm married with a ten-month-old son that takes up much of my time. I enjoy reading, traveling,
                        and while I don't enjoy cooking, I relish in the results of those who do.
                    </p>
