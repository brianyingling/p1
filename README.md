# Project 1
+ By: *Brian Yingling*
+ Production URL: <http://p1.byinglingdwa15.site>

## Outside resources
- I used the minimal Skeleton CSS framework for styling: <http://getskeleton.com/>
- For the styling around the blockquote: <https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/simple-and-nice-blockquote-styling/>
- I pulled the quotes from here:
    - Michael Scott: <http://theopenend.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/michaelscott.jpg>
    - Steve Jobs: <https://www.brainyquote.com/photos_tr/en/s/stevejobs/737723/stevejobs1.jpg>
    - https://geniusquotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Great-quote-famous-Albert-Einstein.png
    - JFK and Neil Armstrong quotes are common knowledge

## Notes for instructor
- Ran into an issue where on my local machine the `<?` tags were working but on production they were not. I had to change them to `<?php`. Not sure why that is; I imagine it must be a setting in PHP somewhere.
- I enjoyed learning about Digital Ocean. Looks like a great IaaS!
